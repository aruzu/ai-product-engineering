### 🎤 Facilitator – Welcome
Hello everyone! Thank you all for joining today's discussion on Viber features. I'm excited to dive into some key improvements that could enhance our user experience. 

We'll be looking at three main topics: the Ad-Free Subscription Option, Streamlined Account Activation & Recovery, and the Performance Optimization Update. 

To kick things off, let’s start with the Ad-Free Subscription Option. How do you feel about the idea of introducing a premium subscription model for an ad-free experience? Would this be something you'd consider?

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 1
Hi everyone! It's great to see you all here. Let's dive right in. 

What are your initial thoughts on the three Viber features we have on the table today: the ad-free subscription option, the streamlined account activation and recovery process, and the performance optimization update? Feel free to share your insights on any or all of them!

#### 👤 Phone Setup Paul
Hey everyone! 

For the Ad-Free Subscription Option, I’d definitely consider it. The intrusive ads are a big pain point for me. They really disrupt my chats with friends and family. 

Streamlined Account Activation & Recovery is another priority. I've had trouble logging in a few times, which can be super frustrating, especially when I need to communicate urgently.

The Performance Optimization Update is also critical. Viber’s sluggish performance and unexpected crashes are annoying, especially when I'm multitasking as a student in Berlin.

Overall, these improvements could significantly enhance my experience with Viber. I hope they address these issues soon!

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Paul! It sounds like the ad-free experience and streamlined activation process are really important to you. 

Can you elaborate on your experience with the login issues? What specific steps do you find most frustrating when trying to get back into Viber, especially during critical moments? Your insights could guide how we might improve that process.

#### 👤 Phone Setup Paul
Sure! Logging into Viber can be quite frustrating. Sometimes, when I enter my phone number, I don’t receive the activation code right away. Other times, the code just doesn’t work, and I have to request a new one multiple times. This is especially stressful when I'm in a hurry, trying to coordinate study groups or arranging plans with friends and family.

Getting stuck in this loop can really disrupt my day. Having a more reliable and faster activation process would make a huge difference in how I use Viber. As a student, efficient communication is vital, and these hiccups can be a big headache.

#### 👤 Version Victor
Yeah, I totally relate to what Paul mentioned about the login process. For me, the last update actually made things even worse—I had trouble activating my account at all. Sometimes Viber just freezes after I input my phone number, and even when it does send a code, the app either crashes or gets stuck on a loading screen. That means I miss out on time-sensitive convos with my family back home or group projects here in Tokyo.

It’s genuinely stressful, especially when I’m rushing between classes and I rely on Viber for quick updates. I think making the activation and login way simpler—and way more reliable—should be a top priority.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for sharing your experiences, Victor! It sounds like the recent update has really impacted your ability to communicate effectively, especially when you're busy with classes. Can you tell us more about specific features or changes that you think could simplify the activation process? For instance, are there particular functionalities you think would help prevent the freezing or crashing issues you've encountered? Your insights could really help inform how we might enhance that user experience.

#### 👤 Version Victor
Absolutely, I have a few ideas based on my struggles. First, the app should have a much faster and lighter activation process—just entering your phone number and instantly getting a code should work without hanging or crashing. Maybe a progress bar or clearer feedback during loading would help, so I know it’s not just frozen.

I’d love a “retry” option right on the same screen if the code doesn’t arrive, rather than starting over. Also, can the app save partially entered info in case it does crash? That way I wouldn’t have to re-enter everything. 

Overall, making activation less resource-heavy and more stable would take a lot of stress out of logging in, especially for students like me on the go.

#### 👤 Call-Cautious Carl
I completely agree with Victor about the activation process needing simplification. As a sales executive, I rely heavily on Viber for urgent communication, and any delay can cost me important connections. 

I've faced frequent crashes and freezes when logging in; sometimes the app fails to send the activation code, leaving me locked out. A straightforward, faster activation would massively improve reliability. Features like a clear progress indicator and a "retry" option would be incredibly beneficial. It would eliminate the anxiety of wondering if the app is just frozen or if I need to start the whole process over. Reliability is key for my work, and these changes could really enhance the user experience.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for your input, Carl! It sounds like reliability in the activation process is crucial for both your professional needs and Victor's as a student. Since you mentioned the importance of speedy communication, could you elaborate on how the current activation issues have directly affected your work? Perhaps you have specific examples where a delayed login cost you time or an opportunity? Your experiences could shed more light on the urgency of these potential improvements!

#### 👤 Call-Cautious Carl
Absolutely, I’d be glad to elaborate. Just last week, I was in the middle of a critical sales negotiation when I suddenly got logged out of Viber. I tried logging back in, but the activation code didn’t come through for nearly 15 minutes. During that time, I lost valuable connection with my client, and they went silent, leading to potential missed revenue. 

In my line of work, every minute counts. When the activation process is so unreliable, it creates a ripple effect on my productivity and can jeopardize deals. That's why a streamlined activation method is essential for someone like me who's always on the go.

#### 👤 Feature-Focused Frank
From my perspective as a team lead, I share Carl’s frustration around reliability—especially during critical moments. While I haven’t experienced frequent crashes, I do find the activation and login process unnecessarily complex at times, especially when switching devices or onboarding new team members. 

For me, missing even a few minutes of communication can disrupt project flow and delay key decisions. A clear progress indicator and "retry" option, as Carl mentioned, would be very useful. I’d also appreciate a way to manage multiple devices more smoothly, since I often switch between desktop and mobile during meetings. 

Dependable, seamless access is vital for my role. The current process sometimes slows down my ability to respond quickly, which is a pain point for daily team coordination.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for sharing that, Carl! It really highlights how critical these moments are in your work. Frank, I appreciate your perspective as a team lead. It sounds like managing multiple devices is a significant challenge for you. Could you share a specific situation where the complexity of switching devices affected your communication? Perhaps a time when you felt it disrupted your project flow? Your insights could help us understand the impact even further.

#### 👤 Feature-Focused Frank
Absolutely. Just last month, I was leading a client call on my desktop when I had to step out for another meeting. I tried to quickly switch to my mobile, but Viber required me to re-verify my account, which took several minutes. During that gap, I missed a key client question and my team was left waiting for my input. 

This isn’t a one-off—every time I switch devices, there’s a risk of losing continuity. For a team lead, those lost minutes can mean delayed decisions or missed opportunities to clarify issues in real-time. A smoother handoff or persistent login across devices would make a big difference in keeping projects on track.

#### 👤 Happy Hannah
Thanks for sharing your experience, Frank! I can really relate to the frustration around interruptions, though for me as a teacher in Berlin, it’s less about device switching and more about the app’s reliability and performance during busy group chats with friends and family. 

I often use Viber to coordinate with colleagues or keep in touch with loved ones, but frequent app crashes and slow performance make it hard to keep up with conversations—especially when I’m trying to quickly respond between classes. Sometimes the app freezes or lags, and I worry about missing important messages or updates.

A smoother, more stable experience would really help me stay connected without the stress of technical hiccups.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for sharing your experience, Hannah! It’s great to hear how Viber fits into your day-to-day life, especially as a teacher juggling multiple conversations. Given your focus on app reliability during busy group chats, could you share a specific instance where a crash or lag led to a missed connection or important update? Understanding that context could help us see how performance impacts your ability to coordinate effectively.

#### 👤 Happy Hannah
Absolutely! One specific instance comes to mind: last month, I was organizing a surprise birthday for a colleague through a big Viber group chat. During a busy school day, I tried to quickly check the group for updates between classes, but the app froze and crashed twice. By the time I got it working again, I’d missed a poll about the venue and a message asking me to bring something specific. 

Because I didn’t see those in time, I showed up unprepared, which was embarrassing. As a teacher, my breaks are short, so I really need the app to be fast and reliable—otherwise, I can’t keep up or contribute effectively.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 2
Hello everyone! I appreciate you all being here today for this discussion about Viber's features. Let's dive right in. 

What do you see as the pros and cons of each feature we’re discussing: the Ad-Free Subscription Option, the Streamlined Account Activation & Recovery, and the Performance Optimization Update? Feel free to share your thoughts on any or all of them!

#### 👤 Phone Setup Paul
Ad-Free Subscription Option: I'd love this feature because ads interrupt my chats, especially when coordinating plans with friends. Less distraction means smoother conversations.

Streamlined Account Activation & Recovery: This is crucial! I've had trouble logging in, and it's been frustrating when I just want to catch up with family quickly. An easier process would be a huge relief.

Performance Optimization Update: Like Hannah, I've experienced app crashes, sometimes missing important updates from my study group. Faster and more reliable performance would definitely enhance my experience.

Being a student, I rely on quick and efficient communication. All these improvements would help Viber fit better into my busy life in Berlin.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for those insights, Paul! I appreciate how you highlighted the importance of each feature for your busy student life. When you mentioned having trouble logging in and the frustration that causes, can you elaborate on what specific aspects of the current account recovery process feel the most cumbersome? Knowing this could help us pinpoint where improvements are needed.

#### 👤 Phone Setup Paul
The most cumbersome part of the current account recovery process is the verification step. It often doesn't send the code promptly, or it gets delayed, leaving me stranded when I need quick access. This is particularly frustrating when I'm trying to join a study group chat or coordinate with friends. Additionally, if I have to reinstall the app, it seems to forget my account details, making it a hassle to re-enter everything. Streamlining this process with more reliable and quicker verification could save a lot of time and stress, especially when balancing student life in Berlin.

#### 👤 Version Victor
Honestly, I completely agree with Paul’s points—especially about account recovery and login. For me, the last update made things even worse. Sometimes, after updating, the app won’t let me log in at all. The verification codes either never arrive or arrive super late. That’s a huge problem for me, since I keep in touch with my family back home in Osaka and use group chats for uni work here in Tokyo. Every time this happens, I miss important messages or deadlines. The process feels unreliable and stressful, especially because I need to get back in quickly. If Viber made login and recovery more stable, it would make a big difference in my daily life.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for sharing that, Victor! It's clear that reliability during account recovery is a shared concern. You mentioned that after updates, the app sometimes doesn’t let you log in at all. Could you tell us more about how often this happens? Do you think there's anything specific about the updates that could be contributing to the login issues? Understanding this might help us identify patterns that need to be addressed.

#### 👤 Version Victor
Honestly, this has happened to me about three times in the last few months—basically, almost every major update lately. Each time, right after updating, I get either stuck on the login screen or wait ages for a verification code that sometimes never comes. I noticed it’s worse when I’m switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data, which is common for me on campus. Before these updates, login was mostly fine, so I definitely think something changed recently. I also wonder if the last update messed with notification permissions, since sometimes Viber just freezes or randomly logs me out. For someone who depends on quick access, this feels like a huge step backward.

#### 👤 Call-Cautious Carl
Absolutely, Victor, I can relate to your experience. I also face significant issues with Viber's login process, particularly after updates. It feels like a gamble whether I can access my account or not, especially when I'm trying to keep in touch with clients or teammates for work. The delays in receiving verification codes are frustrating and can cause me to miss important communications. 

For someone in a sales role who relies heavily on information flow, these issues with login stability and random logouts undermine my efficiency. It's definitely a major pain point for me as well. Improving the reliability of login and address notification permissions would make a world of difference in how I use the app.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Carl! It’s interesting to hear how these login issues impact your work as well. You mentioned feeling like accessing your account is a gamble—do you find this affects your overall use of Viber? Are there specific features you sometimes avoid because of the login instability? Understanding this connection could help us identify how these issues are influencing your daily tasks.

#### 👤 Call-Cautious Carl
Absolutely, the login instability definitely affects my overall use of Viber. I often avoid accessing features like group chats or file sharing during crucial times because I can't risk getting locked out or waiting for a verification code. 

As a sales executive, timing is everything. Missing messages can lead to lost opportunities, which is why I value reliable communication tools. These login issues create a constant sense of uncertainty, making me hesitant to use the app fully, even for essential tasks. Improving these areas would really enhance my experience and performance.

#### 👤 Feature-Focused Frank
Thanks for raising this, facilitator. From my perspective as a team lead, I absolutely see how login instability affects usage. While I haven’t avoided features entirely, I do find myself double-checking access before important meetings or file sharing, just to avoid disruptions. For me, group coordination and quick document exchange are essential, so any uncertainty with login reliability adds unnecessary stress. 

I echo Carl’s point—when you can’t trust the app to be accessible, you hesitate to rely on it for critical team tasks. In my role, missing even a single update from a client or team member can delay projects. I’d really appreciate improvements that make Viber more dependable for daily professional use.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for your insights, Frank! It’s clear that login reliability is crucial for your role as a team lead. You mentioned double-checking access before important meetings—can you share more about how often this occurs? Do you have specific instances where this pre-checking has influenced your workflow or caused delays? Understanding these scenarios can help us pinpoint where improvements might make the biggest impact.

#### 👤 Feature-Focused Frank
Absolutely, happy to elaborate. I’d say I double-check Viber access at least once or twice daily, especially before scheduled client calls or internal team syncs. There was one instance last quarter where I couldn’t log in right before a project kickoff meeting. I had to scramble to notify everyone via email, which disrupted the flow and delayed sharing key documents.

This kind of pre-checking isn’t just a minor habit—it’s become a precaution that eats into my prep time. If login reliability were improved, I could focus more on meeting content and less on technical risks. For someone in my position, that shift would make Viber much more useful and dependable as a professional tool.

#### 👤 Happy Hannah
Thanks for the question! As a teacher who uses Viber mainly to stay in touch with friends and family, I haven’t had to double-check access before meetings like Frank does, but I definitely notice app crashes and freezes—especially when I’m trying to send photos or voice messages after a long school day. Sometimes, the app just stops responding, which is frustrating when I’m trying to share a quick update with my family or coordinate plans with friends.

For me, these issues don’t just interrupt conversations—they make me hesitate to use certain features, like group chats or sending media, because I worry the app might freeze. I’d love to see improvements in stability and responsiveness, so I can rely on Viber for my daily communication without these hiccups.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for sharing that, Hannah! It sounds like those app crashes really affect your ability to communicate smoothly, especially after a long day. You mentioned hesitating to use certain features like group chats or sending media—can you elaborate on how often this hesitation occurs? Are there specific instances where a freeze has impacted your ability to connect with friends or family? Understanding these moments can help us identify areas for improvement that would enhance your experience on Viber.

#### 👤 Happy Hannah
Absolutely, thanks for asking! I’d say I hesitate to use group chats or send media on Viber at least a few times a week—usually in the evenings when I’m winding down after teaching. For example, there was a time when I wanted to send a quick photo from my day to my family group, but the app froze and I had to restart it. By the time it worked, the moment had kind of passed and the conversation had moved on.

These freezes make me less likely to share photos or voice notes spontaneously, which is a big part of how I connect with loved ones. If Viber were more stable, I’d definitely feel more comfortable using all its features regularly!

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 3
Hello everyone! It's great to see you all here today. Let's dive into our discussion about Viber features. 

To start off, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What's the one feature that would most improve your experience with Viber, and why do you feel that way? Feel free to share your perspectives!

#### 👤 Phone Setup Paul
Hey everyone! One feature that would really improve my Viber experience is reducing the intrusive advertisements. They constantly interrupt my use, making the app slower and less responsive. As someone who uses Viber heavily for personal communication with friends and family, these interruptions are really frustrating. I’ve had moments where I'm trying to stay in touch with people back in Germany, and the app just freezes because an ad is loading. If this issue were addressed, I'd have smoother conversations and stay better connected without disruptions.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Paul! It’s clear that the intrusive advertisements are a significant hurdle for you. Can you share any specific instances where an ad has disrupted an important conversation? I'm curious to understand how often this impacts your ability to connect with those back in Germany.

#### 👤 Phone Setup Paul
Sure! One time, I was in a group chat with my family during a birthday celebration back home in Germany. We were exchanging photos and updates, and suddenly an ad popped up, causing the app to freeze. By the time it responded, I missed a series of messages, which made me feel left out. This sort of thing happens frequently, especially during meaningful conversations, really affecting how I stay connected with everyone. It’s frustrating because staying in touch is important to me as a student living abroad.

#### 👤 Version Victor
Honestly, I can totally relate to what Paul is saying about intrusive ads. For me, ads don’t just interrupt—they actually crash the app sometimes, especially after the last update. I use Viber mainly to talk with my friends and family back home, and there have been several times where the app freezes mid-conversation because of pop-up ads. Once, during a call with my sister, the app just stopped working when an ad tried to load. Being in Tokyo and away from family makes smooth communication super important, so these disruptions feel even worse. It’s gotten to a point where I hesitate before opening Viber if I know I need a stable chat.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
That sounds really frustrating, Victor! It's interesting that you mentioned the crashes—could you share more about how often you've experienced this issue since the last update? Has it affected your overall usage of Viber, like switching to other apps for communication?

#### 👤 Version Victor
Yeah, since the last update, the crashes have become almost a daily thing. I’d say Viber freezes or shuts down at least once every two or three conversations, especially if an ad pops up. It’s honestly pushed me to use LINE more often with friends here in Tokyo, just because it’s more reliable and quicker. I used to prefer Viber for family chats because everyone’s on it, but now I sometimes miss important messages or have to switch to a different app to actually finish a call. It’s really disappointing because I just want a stable experience to stay connected with people I care about.

#### 👤 Call-Cautious Carl
I completely agree with Victor about those intrusive ads. I rely on Viber for work-related communication, and the constant interruptions are a real pain. I’ve faced similar issues where the app crashes or freezes during important chats, making it impossible to effectively communicate with clients or colleagues. 

Given that I'm a heavy user and my role demands reliability, these disruptions are frustrating. I often find myself missing critical messages because of the app's slow performance and unresponsiveness. If Viber doesn’t improve its stability, I might have to consider switching to a more dependable app, and that’s disappointing since I’ve been using it for so long.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
That’s a valid point, Carl. It sounds like the instability during critical work communication is particularly concerning for you. Can you share more about how these reliability issues have impacted your work? Have you noticed any particular situations, like important meetings or deadlines, where this has been especially problematic?

#### 👤 Call-Cautious Carl
Absolutely, the reliability issues have been a significant hurdle for me, especially during crucial meetings and tight deadlines. For instance, there was a time I was in a high-stakes negotiation with a client when Viber froze, making me miss vital updates. That led to miscommunication and almost jeopardized the deal.

In my role as a sales executive, timely responses are everything. If I can't trust that Viber will work smoothly, it hampers my productivity and can affect my professional reputation. I really need a tool that I can rely on, not one that adds stress to my day.

#### 👤 Feature-Focused Frank
From my perspective as a team lead, I agree that reliability is non-negotiable, but my main concern is actually around missing *useful features* that would make Viber more practical for daily work. For example, I often need better message organization—like labels or folders for different projects—because I manage multiple client threads at once. Also, advanced search within chats would save me a lot of time when tracking down old discussions.

While stability is important, I find myself wishing for more application features that support professional workflows. These gaps mean I have to supplement Viber with other tools, which isn’t ideal. If Viber added these, it would become my single go-to app for team and client communication.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
That’s an interesting perspective, Frank. You mentioned the need for better message organization, like labels or folders for projects. Can you elaborate on how you currently manage those multiple client threads? What specific features do you think would enhance your workflow in that area?

#### 👤 Feature-Focused Frank
Right now, I manage multiple client threads by pinning the most active chats and manually scrolling to find older ones, which is time-consuming and not scalable as my client list grows. I sometimes use chat search, but it’s basic and doesn’t let me filter by project or keyword efficiently.

What would really help is the ability to create folders or apply labels to chats—like “Project A,” “Internal,” or “Urgent”—so I can quickly sort and access relevant conversations. Also, having advanced search filters (by date, participant, or attachment type) would let me find information much faster. These features would streamline my workflow and reduce the need to juggle multiple apps just to stay organized.

#### 👤 Happy Hannah
As a teacher who uses Viber a lot for personal chats with friends and family, I totally relate to what Frank said about missing features—just from a different angle! For me, it’s not about client threads, but about keeping up with lots of group chats for school events, family, and friends. Sometimes I miss important messages because there’s no easy way to organize or highlight chats. If Viber had folders or labels, I could separate “School,” “Family,” and “Friends” chats, making it so much easier to find what I need.

Also, the search is pretty basic—I’d love to filter by date or sender, especially when looking for old homework discussions or photos. Better organization would really help my daily use!

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
That's a great insight, Hannah! It sounds like better organization and search capabilities could really enhance your experience with Viber, especially given the way you utilize it for both personal and school-related chats. 

You mentioned missing important messages sometimes. Can you share a specific example where better organization or search features would have helped you track down an important message more efficiently?

#### 👤 Happy Hannah
Absolutely! Just last month, I had a parent ask about a school event date that I’d shared weeks earlier in our class group chat. I tried scrolling back, but with all the daily messages from parents and students, it took forever—and I still missed it at first. If I could’ve filtered messages by sender or date, or had a way to tag that message as “Important,” I’d have found it in seconds. As a teacher juggling so many chats, these features would save me time and help me avoid missing key info, both for school and in my personal life.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Closing
Thank you all for your valuable insights today! Your feedback on Viber features has been incredibly enlightening, and I appreciate everyone taking the time to share your thoughts and experiences. 

Each of you brought unique perspectives that will help shape the future of the platform. If there are any final thoughts you'd like to share or if you have any lingering questions, please feel free to do so. Otherwise, I look forward to our next discussion. Have a great day, everyone!
