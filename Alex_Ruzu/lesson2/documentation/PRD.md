## **1. Executive Summary**

### **Product Vision**
Transform product development from assumption-based to evidence-based by creating an automated pipeline that extracts real user insights from review data and validates features through AI-powered user research.

### **Problem Statement**
Traditional product development relies on:
- **Assumption-based personas** created by product teams
- **Stereotypical user archetypes** without data backing
- **Feature prioritization** based on gut feelings rather than user evidence
- **Limited validation** before development investment

This leads to products that miss actual user needs and waste development resources.

### **Solution Overview**
An automated pipeline that:
1. **Analyzes complete user review datasets** using statistical clustering
2. **Extracts real user segments** from actual behavioral data
3. **Generates evidence-based personas** with traceability to source data
4. **Creates features** addressing cluster-identified pain points
5. **Validates features** through AI-powered virtual user board simulation
