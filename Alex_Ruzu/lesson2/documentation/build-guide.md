## **üìã Phase 0: Documentation Generation**
**Duration**: 20 minutes

### **0.1 Product Requirements Document Generation**

#### **Prompt for AI Assistant**:
```
I need to create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a cluster-driven product development pipeline. This is an innovative solution that addresses the problem of assumption-based product development.

Problem Statement:
Traditional product development relies on AI-generated personas and assumptions rather than actual user data, leading to features that don't address real user needs.

Solution Overview:
Create an automated pipeline that:
1. Analyzes complete user review datasets using statistical clustering
2. Extracts real user personas from actual user segments (not AI stereotypes)
3. Generates features addressing cluster-identified pain points
4. Validates features through AI-powered virtual user board simulation

Please create a comprehensive PRD.md that includes:
- Executive summary and product vision
- Target users and use cases
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria
- Risk assessment and future considerations

Key Requirements:
- Process complete user review dataset in under 5 minutes
- Extract 3-5 evidence-based personas with cluster traceability
- Generate 2-3 features per pipeline run
- Use OpenAI Agents SDK for multi-agent validation
- Maintain evidence traceability from clusters to personas to features

Focus on making this production-ready for product teams, emphasizing data-driven insights over assumptions.
```

### **0.2 Technical Requirements Document Generation**

#### **Prompt for AI Assistant**:
```
Now create a comprehensive Technical Requirements Document (TRD) for implementing the cluster-driven product development pipeline.

Based on the PRD requirements, specify the complete technical architecture:

System Architecture:
- Data processing layer (pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK)
- AI integration layer (OpenAI API, Agents SDK)
- Infrastructure components (logging, validation, artifact management)

Key Technical Requirements:
1. Python 3.9+ with scikit-learn for K-means clustering and TF-IDF vectorization
2. OpenAI API integration for feature generation with retry logic
3. OpenAI Agents SDK for multi-agent virtual board simulation
4. Pydantic for data validation and type safety
5. Professional logging with separated business vs technical logs
6. Environment-based configuration management
7. Session-based artifact management
8. Performance targets: complete dataset processing in <5 minutes, <2GB RAM usage

Please create TRD.md with:
- Complete system architecture diagrams
- Technology stack specifications
- Component specifications with APIs
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security and reliability considerations
- Infrastructure and deployment specifications
- Testing requirements
- API specifications and data schemas

Make this suitable for engineering teams to implement a production-ready system.
```

### **0.3 Expected Deliverables**

#### **Prompt for AI Assistant**:
```
Based on the PRD and Technical Requirements documents we just created, let's start implementing the cluster-driven product development pipeline.

I want to build a data-driven product development pipeline that analyzes user reviews to extract real user segments and generate features. The solution should:

1. Use clustering analysis on user review data (not AI-generated personas)
2. Extract personas from actual user clusters with evidence traceability
3. Generate features addressing cluster-identified pain points
4. Validate through AI-powered virtual user board simulation
5. Provide professional logging and artifact management

Key Requirements from our PRD/TRD:

- Use statistical clustering (K-means + TF-IDF)
- Maintain evidence traceability from clusters to personas to features
- Implement OpenAI Agents SDK for multi-agent simulation
- Separate operational logs (logs/) from user outputs (docs/)
- Professional configuration management via .env files

Please start by creating the basic project structure, configuration files, and dependency management that aligns with our technical requirements.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: This project MUST use the conda environment 'edu_ai_prod_eng2'. Always include conda activation commands in your setup instructions. Common issues occur when Python commands are run outside the conda environment.
```

### **1.2 Expected Deliverables**
- ‚úÖ Project directory structure
- ‚úÖ `.env` and `.env.example` configuration files
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` with core dependencies
- ‚úÖ Basic `README.md` and auto-generated `CLAUDE.md` (via /init)

### **1.3 Configuration Setup**

#### **Create `.env` file**:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always activate conda environment first
source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate edu_ai_prod_eng2 && cd lesson2

# Create .env file with configuration
cat > .env << 'EOF'
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7

# Pipeline Configuration
MIN_FEATURES=2
MAX_FEATURES=3
MAX_CLUSTER_PERSONAS=5
VIRTUAL_BOARD_ROUNDS=3

# Advanced Settings
CLUSTERING_MIN_K=3
CLUSTERING_MAX_K=15
TFIDF_MAX_FEATURES=1000
EOF
```

#### **Create `.env.example`**:
```bash
# Copy .env structure with placeholder values
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
# ... etc
```

Key Focus: Statistical accuracy and evidence traceability as defined in our PRD. Personas should represent real user segments, not stereotypes.

IMPORTANT: Follow these quality gates during implementation:
1. Verify all personas trace back to specific cluster data and review evidence
2. Ensure features address actual pain points identified through clustering analysis
3. Validate that personas represent real user segments, not AI-generated stereotypes
