Sometimes when I write a sentence it would send but keep the last word of it and send it right after my message. Another thing is my aliases. I would go and put a 30 or more character alias and it would say alias error even tho the limit of characters is 40. Besides, why do spaces count as characters anyway? It even shows the incorrect number of subscribers in a channel or none sometimes",
