User Request: Add an undo option for deletions

Competitive Analysis:
- Google Drive offers a 30-day undo history
- Dropbox provides an undo feature in their web interface
- Notion has a comprehensive undo system with keyboard shortcuts

Implementation Plan:
1. Add an undo stack to track recent deletions
2. Implement a keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + Z) for undo
3. Add an undo button in the UI toolbar
4. Store deletion metadata for 30 days

Benefits:
- Reduces user anxiety about accidental deletions
- Improves user experience by providing a safety net
- Aligns with industry standard practices
- Minimal performance impact as we'll only store recent deletions"""
